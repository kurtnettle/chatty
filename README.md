### App Name Story

One of my Scottish cousin used to say chatty/chatterbox so while looking for a name that aligns with the context of chat bot project I thought of going with it.

2. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation) (by this time most of the python devs should have this already)

3. Open terminal then type `uv run invoke run` and enter

## Repo is archived 📂

**TLDR:** This was just a task given by my faculty and I don't have any plans to continue the support or improvement of this app.

This was a project given by my faculty when I asked him to consider the late submission of assignment. I am grateful he gave a project like this. I was unfamiliar with this tech and have never worked earlier (even i wasn't aware of the package name streamlit and langchain!). In the commitment of learning a new tech, I can proudly say I haven't took help of AI while doing this project.
